### Spotify API
This project is a .NET 8.0 API that serves as a proxy to the Spotify API. It includes features like OAuth authentication, logging with Serilog, profiling with MiniProfiler, and request auditing.

##Features
OAuth Integration: Securely access Spotify API data with OAuth tokens.
MiniProfiler: Integrated for profiling API performance and queries.
Serilog: Logging is set up for debugging, information, and error logging.
Custom Middleware: AuditMiddleware is used to log incoming requests and responses.
Swagger Documentation: Auto-generated API documentation is available via Swagger UI.
Health Checks: Used to monitor the health and readiness of the API.
#Prerequisites
.NET 8.0 SDK
A valid Spotify Client ID and Client Secret.

##Logging
Serilog is used for logging to the console. Logs are categorized into informational and error logs.
Audit logs are generated by AuditMiddleware and can be extended for better monitoring and tracking.
Unit Testing
Unit tests are implemented using MSTest, with the goal of achieving over 80% code coverage. Key test cases include:

OAuth token retrieval and refresh.
API responses and business logic validation.
Middleware coverage for auditing and error handling.
Profiling and healt
